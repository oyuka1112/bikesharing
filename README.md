## Summary
We see that the customers during this period is mostly male. Downtown is the busiest area, which we should provide with more bikes. During the rush hours, we should hire more workers to maintain the stable operation. 
Two additional visualization for future analysis:
1. We could analyze if the age and the weekday correlation.
2. We could analyze duration and the location correlation.
